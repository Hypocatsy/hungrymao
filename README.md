<p>*hungrymao will snack while you decide*</br>
 1. Key in your postal code (if you don't remember, [let hungrymao Google it for you](https://lmgtfy.app/?q=my+postal+code+here) </br>
 2. Key in your food restrictions, or not.</br>
 3. Find the cat eating bread, and spin the wheel. You can spin as many times as you want, but hungrymao can only help you with Japanese, Korean, Indian, Italian, Chinese, and     Mexican Food. </br>
 
 >  Hungrymao will judge you for your indecisiveness üëÄ
